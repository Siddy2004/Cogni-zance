//PROBLEM-1

Write pseudocode and flowchart for a program that outputs ‘True’ if a given number is divisible by 3 and ‘False’ otherwise, without using the ‘%’ operator explicitly (like N % 3 == 0).

//PSEUDO CODE

main

    Declare integer variable num
    Get the input of variable num from the user


    while num is greater than zero
        Subtract 3 from num and assign it to num
    END while
 
    if num is equal to zero then
	print response
            "True"
    
    else
        print response
            "False"
    END if

END main
