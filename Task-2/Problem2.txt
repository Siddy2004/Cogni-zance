//PROBLEM-2

Write pseudocode and flowchart for program that prints Nth fibonacci number. 
(Nth Fibonacci Number denoted as F(N), F(0)=0, F(1)=1, F(2)=1, F(3)=2,â€¦)

//PSEUDO CODE

main
    
    Declare and initialise variable first equal to 0
    Declare and initialise variable second equal to 1
    Declare and initialise variable fib equal to 0

    Get the input of Nth number from the user

    for variable i ranging from 1 to Nth number
        Add the values of first and second and assign it to fib
        Assign the value of second to first
        Assign the value of fib to second
    END for

    print fib

END main
